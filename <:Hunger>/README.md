The following libraries are used-

Pyttsx3 Library- pyttsx3 is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python. Unlike alternative libraries, it works offline and is compatible with both Python 2 and 3.

Speech Recognition- For performing Speech Recognition, there is SpeechRecognition library which is open source and several engines and APIs provide in both modes online and offline mode. 

NLTK- The Natural Language Toolkit(NLTK), is a suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing (NLP) for English written in the Python programming language. It provides a practical introduction to programming for language processing.

spaCy- It’s a free and open-source library for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python with a lot of in-built capabilities. It’s used for processing and analyzing data in NLP. 

Maxent_ne_chunker- The maxent_ne_chunker contains two pre-trained English named entity chunkers. It is used by the nltk.ne_chunk() function. 


Treebank- It’s a collection of syntactically annotated sentences in which the annotation is checked so that it  can serve as a training corpus for natural language parsers, as a repository for linguistic research, or as an evaluation corpus for NLP systems.

maxent_treebank_pos_tagger- NLTK is a fantastic library to support NLP. It provides a number of tagging models. The default tagging model is the maxent_treebank_pos_tagger.

Punkt- This tokenizer divides a text into a list of sentences, by using an unsupervised algorithm to build a model for abbreviation words, collocations, and words that start sentences. 

averaged_perceptron_tagger- The perceptron part-of-speech tagger implements part-of-speech tagging using the averaged, structured perceptron algorithm.

Location Tagger- Return the entity with location information.
